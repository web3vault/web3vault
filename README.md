Web3Vault is a cutting-edge solution designed to enhance the security and accessibility of private and sensitive data in the blockchain space. This desktop application serves as a secure repository for passwords and personnal notes, leveraging well established encryption methods (like AES256) to safeguard user data and assets. 

Web3Vault is available on the following Operating Systems:

- MacOS (both `arm64` and `amd64`)
- Windows
- Linux

Web3Vault synchronisation is using smart contract deployed on the [Base](https://www.base.org/) network, allowing user to sync their password database between different devices with ease of use, fast and cheap transactions.

You could find the verified contract on the [Base Blockscout block explorer](https://base.blockscout.com/address/0xB85e9607a719a1d51963114aF94F49dAa1335aF1?tab=contract)
